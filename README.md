\# Predicting Complications Risk in Type 2 Diabetes ManagementThis repository provides the implementation used in the paper:"Predicting complications in type 2 diabetes management using personalized digital twins: A focus on early intervention and prevention strategies".\## DatasetThe experiments are conducted using the public BRFSS 2015 dataset:diabetes\_012\_health\_indicators\_BRFSS2015.csvThe dataset is publicly available and derived from the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).\## ModelsThe following machine learning models are implemented:\- Random Forest Classifier\- XGBoost Classifier\## Feature EngineeringSeveral interaction and composite features are constructed, including:\- Patient characteristics index\- Health status index\- Lifestyle score\- Healthcare access indicator\- Age-related risk interactions\## How to Run1\. Install the required dependencies:   pip install -r requirements.txt2\. Place the dataset file in the same directory as the Python script.3\. Run the model script:   python run\_models.py\## OutputThe script outputs:\- Accuracy and classification report\- ROC-AUC score\- 5-fold cross-validation accuracy for each model\## ReproducibilityThe provided code and dataset allow full reproduction of the experimental results reported in the paper.\## This code is provided for research reproducibility purposes.
